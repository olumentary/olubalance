# Linode Storage Migration - Complete Solution

## Overview

This solution provides a complete migration path from AWS S3 to Linode S3-compatible storage for your Rails application's transaction attachments. The migration is designed to be safe, reversible, and includes comprehensive verification steps.

## What's Been Created

### 1. Updated Storage Configuration (`config/storage.yml`)

- Added Linode S3-compatible storage configurations for both development and production
- Maintains existing AWS S3 configurations for rollback capability
- Uses environment variables for secure credential management

### 2. Migration Rake Tasks (`lib/tasks/migrate_to_linode_storage.rake`)

- `storage:migrate_to_linode` - Transaction-level migration
- `storage:migrate_blobs_to_linode` - Blob-level migration (recommended)
- `storage:verify_linode_migration` - Verification of migrated attachments
- `storage:cleanup_aws_attachments` - Safe cleanup of old AWS attachments
- `storage:status` - Current storage status and statistics

### 3. Migration Script (`bin/migrate_to_linode`)

- Interactive script that guides you through the entire migration process
- Includes safety checks and confirmations
- Provides step-by-step guidance

### 4. Documentation (`docs/LINODE_MIGRATION.md`)

- Comprehensive migration guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Rollback instructions
- Environment variable setup guide

### 5. Environment Configuration (`config/application.yml.sample`)

- Updated with Linode environment variables
- Maintains existing configuration structure

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. Set up Linode Object Storage account
2. Create buckets for development and production
3. Generate S3-compatible access keys
4. Configure environment variables

### Phase 2: Deployment

1. Deploy the updated code with new storage configuration
2. Set Linode environment variables in your deployment environment
3. Verify configuration with `bundle exec rails storage:status`

### Phase 3: Migration

1. Run the migration script: `./bin/migrate_to_linode`
2. Or run manually:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rails storage:migrate_blobs_to_linode
   bundle exec rails storage:verify_linode_migration
   ```

### Phase 4: Switchover

1. Update environment configuration to use Linode storage
2. Redeploy the application
3. Verify all attachments are working correctly

### Phase 5: Cleanup (Optional)

1. After successful verification, clean up AWS S3 attachments
2. Run: `bundle exec rails storage:cleanup_aws_attachments`

## Key Features

### Safety

- **Non-destructive**: Original AWS S3 files remain until explicitly cleaned up
- **Verification**: Multiple verification steps ensure data integrity
- **Rollback capability**: Can easily switch back to AWS S3 if needed
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and reporting

### Efficiency

- **Blob-level migration**: More efficient than transaction-level approach
- **Batch processing**: Handles large numbers of attachments efficiently
- **Progress tracking**: Shows detailed progress during migration

### Monitoring

- **Status reporting**: Detailed statistics and status information
- **Error logging**: Comprehensive error reporting for troubleshooting
- **Verification**: Multiple verification methods to ensure success

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Linode S3-compatible storage
LINODE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
LINODE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
LINODE_ENDPOINT=https://your-region.linodeobjects.com
LINODE_REGION=your-region
LINODE_BUCKET_NAME=your-production-bucket
LINODE_BUCKET_NAME_DEV=your-development-bucket
```

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Cost Savings**: Linode Object Storage is often more cost-effective than AWS S3
2. **S3 Compatibility**: Uses the same API, so no code changes needed
3. **Global CDN**: Built-in content delivery network
4. **Simple Pricing**: No complex tiered pricing structure
5. **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with other Linode services

## Testing

The solution has been tested with:

- ✅ Rake task creation and execution
- ✅ Storage configuration updates
- ✅ Environment variable integration
- ✅ Migration script functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Linode Object Storage**: Create your account and buckets
2. **Configure environment variables**: Add the Linode credentials to your deployment environment
3. **Deploy the updated code**: Deploy with the new storage configuration
4. **Run the migration**: Use the provided migration script or rake tasks
5. **Verify and switchover**: Ensure everything works before switching to Linode storage
6. **Cleanup**: Remove old AWS S3 attachments after successful migration

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the comprehensive documentation in `docs/LINODE_MIGRATION.md`
2. Use the troubleshooting section for common issues
3. Verify your Linode Object Storage configuration
4. Test the migration on a development environment first

The migration solution is designed to be robust and safe, with multiple verification steps and rollback capabilities to ensure a smooth transition to Linode storage.
